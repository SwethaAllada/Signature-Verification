# Signature-Verification
Signature verification is a crucial aspect of authentication, commonly used in banking, legal, and financial sectors. It ensures the identity of individuals by comparing signatures to stored templates. However, the process is prone to challenges such as forgery and variability in handwriting. 
# MODEL TRAINING 
Data Preparation: <br> The dataset of signature images is preprocessed, normalized, and augmented to ensure robust training data. <br>
YOLO Implementation: <br> The YOLO model is utilized for detecting signature features by leveraging its real-time detection capabilities. <br>
Model Optimization: <br> YOLO is fine-tuned for better accuracy in distinguishing between genuine and forged signatures by adjusting the architecture and loss functions.
